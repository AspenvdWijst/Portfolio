        <strong>Me and media</strong>
        I was born on the 27th of March in 2004. For a long time, I had the idea that I'd become a radio presenter.
        I was actively working to improve my presenting skill and my knowledge of all kinds of music. However, that dream faded after I had tried
        everything I could. I kept hearing "no" from everything that I tried.

        This made me get a lot of skills related to the production of events.
        I did a study to learn how to produce events, and I even lead some bigger productions, like a 10-hour-long radio show for charity.
        This caused me to be very capable at working, and leading, teams.

        I even started writing for this online music magazine called <a href="https://www.strifemag.com" target="_blank">Strife Magazine</a>. They also taught me a lot about producing interviews
        and reviews on a higher level. My love for music is never something that I will lose,
        and I draw a lot of inspiration from the music that I'm listening to at the time.

        <strong>Me and software development</strong>
        After this I was wondering what to do next. I thought long and hard about my past passions,
        and I remembered that I have always done a lot with software.
        Ever since I got my first phone, I've been working on modifying devices. I rooted my first phone and I put homebrew on my old Nintendo 3DS.
        I had previously tried to get into code. But I never knew where, and more importantly, how to start.

        That made me decide to start this study, software development. I immediately started learning a lot about web development.
        Within a few weeks I had learned a bunch of HTML and CSS. Then we moved on to things like javascript, php, and sql.
        Which proved themselves more difficult than the first two. However, after a little bit of work. I eventually learned how to work with those too.

        That is where I am at now. Still learning a lot, and continuing to improve. Creating this portfolio also taught me a lot about coding,
        and what does, or doesn't work.
