    <pre>
        I was born on the 27th of March in 2004. For a long time, I had the idea that I'd become a radio presenter. I was actively working to improve my presenting skills and my knowledge of all kinds of music.<br>
        However, that dream faded after I had tried everything I could. I kept hearing "no" from everything that I tried.<br> This made me get a lot of skills related to the production of events.
        <br><br>I did a study to learn how to produce events, and I even lead some bigger productions, like a 10-hour-long radio show for charity. This caused me to be very capable at working, and leading, teams.<br>
        After this I was wondering what to do next. I thought long and hard about my past passions. And I remembered that I have always done a lot with software.<br>
        Ever since I got my first phone, I've been working on modifying devices. I rooted my first phone and I put homebrew on my old Nintendo 3DS.<br>
        I had previously tried to get into code. But I never knew where, and more importantly, how to start.<br><br>
