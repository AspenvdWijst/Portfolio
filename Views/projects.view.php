My most recent project is this website. I have worked and brainstormed about this website so much.
Working on this has lead me to become better at not only things like: HTML, CSS, javascript, PHP and SQL.
But it has also caused me to improve my designing skills. I have reworked the look of the website a few times to where it is now.
Every time I looked at something else, and this has caused me to be able to make quick edits on the website whenever I need to.
There is always room for improvement, and in the future there will most likely be a bunch of it too.

I did a 10 hour radio marathon that raised money for charity. I had the role of not just presenter, but also head of production.
I made sure everyone stayed on course with the preparation for the show, and jumped in where needed. Even during the day I was flying around.
In the end we raised â‚¬1.345 for the charity War Child. We had talked with people directly affected by the war,
but we also talked to scholars about the war that was happening in Ukraine. We even talked to the CEO of the Dutch branch of War Child.
In all of this, I made sure that the right people talked to the right people. And that everything went as planned, and if not. I'd find a solution.

I've been working for <a href="https://www.strifemag.com" target="_blank">Strife Magazine</a> sine 2022. What started as a coincidence, quickly lead to a great bond with the owners
of the online music magazine. Since then I have written concert reviews, shot concert photography and I've prepared and conducted interviews.
I have also upheld proper communication with multiple management teams of various bands.
